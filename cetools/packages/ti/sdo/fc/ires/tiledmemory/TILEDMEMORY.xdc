     *  Base value of keys of Linux IPC objects used by TILEDMEMORY.

     *  This applies only to Linux-based environments. The IPC objects

     *  value, and incrementing with each new object. There are currently
     *  three IPC objects, so keys in the range of ipcKeyBase to ipcKeyBase + 2
     *  will be reserved for TILEDMEMORY. The default value of ipcKeyBase is
     *  ascii code for "2VDH".
     *
     *  WARNING: This value should only be changed if it conflicts with
     *  another IPC key in the system that cannot be changed. If this value
     *  is changed, all programs using TILEDMEMORY that will be run
     *  simultaneously must have the ipcKeyBase configured to the new value.
